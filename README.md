Project Overview
This project demonstrates the Aggregation Relationship concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), focusing on how objects can be associated with one another to form complex systems. The goal is to showcase the "has-a" relationship between classes, which allows for modular, reusable, and organized code structures.

What is Aggregation?
Aggregation is a form of association where a class is composed of one or more instances of other classes. It represents a "whole-part" relationship, where:

The "whole" is the aggregating class that contains instances of other classes (the "parts").
The parts can exist independently outside the lifecycle of the "whole."
For example, a Library class can contain Book instances without having ownership over the Book objects. If the Library is deleted, the Book objects can still exist.

Features
This project includes:

Simple Classes: Basic examples of classes that can be combined to form aggregate relationships.
Aggregation Example: Code examples illustrating how a class can "have" one or more other objects without taking ownership.
Detailed Comments: Explanations within the code to aid understanding of how aggregation differs from composition and association.
Code Structure
The codebase is organized as follows:

MainClass.java: Contains the main method, demonstrating the aggregation concept through instantiation and interaction.
Library.java: The aggregating class, representing a library containing books.
Book.java: A simple class representing a book object that exists independently of the library.

Example Code Snippet

public class Library {
    private List<Book> books;

    public Library(List<Book> books) {
        this.books = books;
    }

    public List<Book> getBooksInLibrary() {
        return books;
    }
}

public class Book {
    private String title;

    public Book(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }

    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }
}

// Demonstration in MainClass.java
public class MainClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Book book1 = new Book("1984");
        Book book2 = new Book("To Kill a Mockingbird");

        List<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();
        books.add(book1);
        books.add(book2);

        Library library = new Library(books);

        System.out.println("Books in Library:");
        library.getBooksInLibrary().forEach(book -> System.out.println(book.getTitle()));
    }
}

How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/mtaqi04/Aggregation-Relationship.git

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

3. Compile and run MainClass.java to see aggregation in action.


Key Takeaways
Aggregation allows classes to "have" other classes without implying ownership.
This project illustrates how aggregation can lead to better code organization and reusability in OOP.
